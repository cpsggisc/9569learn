Propose a task on version control for students (can be theory or practical, maybe best hybrid/integrated) :)

1. Integrate into group projects.
   - Start each team with a starting template (e.g. Flask app template).
   - Create a new Github repository with this template. No members are allowed to commit directly to `main` branch.
   - Each member of the team is to create a separate branch to develop a feature for the app.
   - When the feature is ready and tested, they merge their code into the app by submitting a pull request.
   - The team leader (the most experienced member of the team) approves the branch if it meets requirements.
