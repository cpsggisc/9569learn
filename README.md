# Version Control

> Save Early, Save Often â€” *Every programmer who lost their code*

Imagine you are taking short notes down in `Word`. You made some more changes to the notes, delete some sections. Before you close the file, it prompted you to save and you clicked `Yes` . Right after you click, you realized you deleted the wrong sections! *Sianz. Now I gotta find those parts of the notes and reinsert.* Well, you wouldn't need to go through all this experience if you would have used version control.

# So, what is Version Control?

Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.  

Fortunately, this system is so ubiquitous right now and you might even have used them in Google Docs under `File>Version History>See Version History` to restore that important paragraph that your project mate deleted for your group project ðŸ¤£.

There are multiple version control systems out there like Apache's `Subversion`, Concurrent Versions System ( `CVS`), but we will be using Git (which why this file is hosted on github)
